## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

Ive been on haiatus from coding for a bit so this is a come-back project. Re-learning how to add Javascript to my websites and what i can accomplish with it. One big thing i recall doing that seemed super important to understand is saving info with localStorage in JS so that certain information can be used in other pages.


### Continued development

One big thing i need to focus on is readability with my code aswell as optimization. Just starting out its hard to know what should/shouldnt be there and what different ways to accomplish certain tasks. I feel a lot of times, im taking forever to do something so simple and that it could probably be done in a different and easier way but i know itll get better in time.

Google is my best friend. From coming back to coding, i had so many obstacles. I forgot how to do a lot of things and google was obviously my best friend. w3 schools in particular was very very helpful aswell as WebDevSimplified on youtube.
